// 1. make sure questions.js file is above logic.js so it loads first

// 2. use an array with parenthasis inside of it

// 3. use this format - question at the top, choices in the middle and answer at the bottom. 
    // 3a. use \n to go on to a new line
    // 3b. work on the logic before the answers. highscores in local storage maybe.
